/** readme
 

io.emit - sends to everyone(including the sender)
socket.emit - sends event to socket(sender)
socket.broadcast.emit - sends event to all other sockets except the one that sent the event
socket.on("eventname") - listen for events
socket.to("room-name").emit - sends event to a specific room

WHY WE NEED HTTP SERVER

app.listen is a shorthand provided by Express. Internally, it calls http.createServer(app) for you and starts the 
server listening on the specified port. However, when you use app.listen(port), you donâ€™t have direct access to the 
http.Server instance created by Express. This becomes a problem for Socket.IO, which needs to attach itself to the 
http.Server instance.

Why Socket.IO Needs http.Server

Socket.IO works on top of the HTTP protocol but also uses the WebSocket protocol for real-time communication.
It needs to "hook into" the same HTTP server that serves your Express application to handle WebSocket upgrades. 
By explicitly creating the server with http.createServer(app) and passing it to Socket.IO, you allow Socket.IO to:

Intercept WebSocket upgrade requests.
Share the same port as your HTTP server.
